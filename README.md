A simple game of rock paper scissors with a basic user interface

This is a simple rock paper scissors game initially created in it's 
most basic form by following The Odin Project's "Project: Rock Paper 
Scissors" lesson and updated in later lessons.

It was initially created for playing the game from the browser console 
and was later updated to have a very basic graphical user interface 
with buttons and text.
